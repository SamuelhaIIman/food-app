# 🛒 Food App — Grocery Budgeting Tool for Finland

## 📌 About

**Food App** is a smart budgeting tool designed to help people in Finland plan and track their grocery expenses more efficiently — focusing on stores like **S-Market**.  
It started as a personal project to improve my own budgeting habits and is now evolving into a user-friendly website to help others save money and make informed shopping decisions.
